## My process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup** â€“ For clean and accessible HTML structure.
- **React** â€“ JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** â€“ For type safety and enhanced development experience.
- **Mobile-First Workflow** â€“ Ensures a responsive design from the start.
- **Material-UI** â€“ For modern and accessible UI components.
- **Styled-Components** â€“ For scoped and dynamic CSS styling.
- **React Router** â€“ For seamless navigation between views.
- **JSON-Server** â€“ Mock backend for simulating API responses.

### What I Learned

This project enhanced my skills in implementing core features like:

- User authentication: Registration, login, and session management.
- File uploads: Handling and managing user-uploaded files effectively.

Example code snippet demonstrating a simple functionality:

```javascript
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

Advanced Identity and Access Management (IAM) for role-based access control and enhanced security.
Integration with a production-grade backend for improved scalability and performance.

### Useful resources

- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) - A robust tool for managing CSS in JavaScript. It streamlined styling in this project and will remain a go-to for future work.
